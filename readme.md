### Data Visualisation

The final project is viewable [here]().

#### What was the project about?
I received an assignment to incorporate graphs into an already-provided website. The source code files are everything in the assets folder and were provided for me. The `index.html` was also provided for me. I was not allowed to change anything in the HTML except to add scripts.

#### The Objective
The objective was to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and place 3 charts in specific places using chart.js. I used the data from the tables provided to fill said charts using `for` loops. The first chart is an interactive chart that should be updating every second, but due to limitations with the CORS proxy CORS Anywhere, I limited the chart visibility to once per reload. If you reload the page it will refresh, but CORS Anywhere limits its requests to 200 per 60 minutes.

#### What I Learned
I learned a couple things.
- How to pull data from a table and select individual cells and rows with a combination of `for` loops and write the data elsewhere.
- How to create your own `JSON` file and reference the code using your own hosted server.
- How to use chart.js to convey data visually.
- Using AJAX to access a proxy and connect it to a URL.
